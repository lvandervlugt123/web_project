## My proposal
- I play a lot of padel tennis in boston at a padel club, they already have a website but I'm thinking of creating a website page for the student members of the club
🟢 1️⃣ Clean Informational + Signup Hub (Baseline)

A modern student club site with:

Home
About the Club
Practice Schedule
Tournament Calendar
Join Form
Photo Gallery
Contact

Features:
• Embedded Google Form for membership
• Countdown to next tournament
• Instagram feed embed
• Court location map

Good if you want something clean and polished.

🟡 2️⃣ Matchmaking System (Way More Interesting)

This would be awesome.

Students create profiles:

Name
Skill level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)
Availability
Preferred play times

Then the site:
• Matches players by skill
• Suggests doubles pairings
• Suggests available match slots

You could build simple JS filtering logic.

That would impress your professor.

🔵 3️⃣ Padel ELO Ranking System

Now we’re cooking.

Track:
• Match results
• Wins / losses
• Dynamic ranking
• Leaderboard

Features:
• Submit match result form
• Auto update rankings
• Weekly leaderboard
• "Player of the Week"

That’s interactive.
That’s real logic.
That’s a strong final project.

🟣 4️⃣ Court Booking Interface (Simulated)

Students:
• View available times
• Click to book
• See calendar view

You could simulate backend using:
Local storage or mock JSON data.

This shows:
• DOM manipulation
• State management
• Interactivity

Very strong academically.

🔴 5️⃣ Tournament Bracket Generator

Students:
• Enter players
• System auto-generates bracket
• Shows winner progression

This requires:
• Dynamic rendering
• Event listeners
• Array logic

This is very impressive for an intro web course.

🟠 6️⃣ Social + Community Focused Site

Add:
• Player profiles
• Highlight clips
• Match history
• Padel tips section
• Beginner onboarding guide

You could even integrate:
Weather API → “Best time to play today”
